# MCP Python Executor - TODO List

## Completed Items

- [x] Implement `execute_python_file` tool for executing Python files within virtual environments
  - Added interface definition and validation function
  - Implemented handler method with proper error handling and timeouts
  - Updated documentation in README.md and ARCHITECTURE.md

## Planned Improvements

- [ ] Add support for additional parameters to `execute_python_file`:
  - Command line arguments for the Python script
  - Environment variables specific to the execution
  - Working directory specification
  
- [ ] Improve error handling and diagnostics:
  - Add more detailed error reporting for common Python exceptions
  - Implement support for capturing and returning Python stack traces
  - Add runtime statistics (execution time, memory usage) to the response

- [ ] Enhance security features:
  - Implement path validation for file paths to prevent directory traversal
  - Add support for execution within a sandbox
  - Add proper file permission checking before execution

- [ ] Performance optimizations:
  - Implement caching for frequently executed files
  - Add support for concurrent execution of multiple files
  - Optimize virtual environment switching

- [ ] Testing and validation:
  - Write unit tests for the new `execute_python_file` tool
  - Perform integration testing with different Python versions
  - Create benchmarks for performance comparison
