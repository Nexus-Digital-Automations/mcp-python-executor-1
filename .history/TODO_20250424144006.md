# Python Executor MCP Server - TODO List

## Completed Tasks

1. ‚úÖ Configuration Update
   - Changed config.ts to replace `useVirtualEnv` and `venvPath` with `venvsBasePath` and `defaultVenvName`
   - Made `loadConfig()` asynchronous to create the venvsBasePath directory if it doesn't exist
   - Updated PythonConfig and ServerConfig interfaces to reflect these changes
   - Changed all references in the code to use the new configuration properties

2. ‚úÖ Virtual Environment Management
   - Created a dedicated VenvManager class in venvUtils.ts with methods for:
     - Validating venv names to prevent directory traversal attacks
     - Getting venv paths safely
     - Checking if a venv exists
     - Setting up (creating) virtual environments
     - Locking mechanism for concurrent operations (withVenvLock)
     - Getting environment details and metadata
     - Listing all available environments

3. ‚úÖ Tools API Expansion
   - Added new MCP tools for multi-venv management:
     - `list_venvs`: Lists all available venvs with their details
     - `create_venv`: Creates a new virtual environment
     - `delete_venv`: Deletes an existing virtual environment
     - `set_venv_description`: Updates the description for a venv

4. ‚úÖ Command Security Refactoring
   - Refactored command execution to improve security
   - Added array-based command execution with spawn for better security
   - Added proper error handling and validation for user input
   - Maintained legacy string-based execution for Windows activation scripts while implementing security improvements

5. ‚úÖ Per-Tool Virtual Environment Support
   - Updated tool inputSchema definitions to include optional venvName parameter for:
     - execute_python
     - install_packages 
     - uninstall_packages
     - list_packages
     - health_check
     - analyze_code (new tool)
   - Updated handler methods to accept and process the venvName parameter
   - Fixed getVenvPath to use the VenvManager's getVenvPath method
   - Updated getActivationPrefix to accept venvName parameter
   - Updated checkVenvExists to use VenvManager
   - Updated getInstalledPackages to accept venvName
   - Added implementation for handleAnalyzeCode with venvName support

6. ‚úÖ Complete Tool Implementations
   - Completed `handleExecutePython` method to use the specified venv
   - Completed `handleInstallPackages` method to install packages in the specified venv
   - Completed `handleUninstallPackages` method to uninstall packages from the specified venv
   - Updated methods to use secure command execution techniques
   - Implemented proper error handling and response formatting

7. ‚úÖ Integration of Virtual Environment Handling in Existing Tools
   - Updated all handler methods (handleExecutePython, handleInstallPackages, handleUninstallPackages, handleListPackages, handleHealthCheck, handleAnalyzeCode) to use the VenvManager
   - Updated getInstalledPackages method to use VenvManager
   - Modified verifyPythonVersion to check the target virtual environment instead of the system Python
   - Standardized the approach to handling venvName parameters across all tools
   - Improved error handling for virtual environment operations
   - Implemented consistent target environment name determination

8. ‚úÖ Removed Preinstalled Packages
   - Removed predefined packages from config.ts
   - Updated initializePreinstalledPackages function to handle empty packages list
   - Removed PREINSTALLED_PACKAGES environment variable from README.md
   - Updated documentation to indicate that no packages are preinstalled by default

## Pending Tasks

1. üîÑ Testing
   - Add tests for the VenvManager class
   - Add tests for the modified handler methods
   - Test multi-venv operations
   - Test concurrent operations with the locking mechanism
   - Test security improvements with malicious inputs

2. üîÑ Documentation
   - Update API documentation
   - Add examples for using the multi-venv functionality
   - Document security considerations
   - Complete inline code documentation

3. üîÑ Advanced Features
   - Implement dependency resolution to handle package conflicts
   - Add package version compatibility checking
   - Implement environment export/import functionality
   - Add metrics collection for performance monitoring

4. üîÑ Performance Optimizations
   - Implement caching for installed packages data
   - Optimize operations for large numbers of venvs
   - Add batched operations for package management

## Known Issues

1. ‚ö†Ô∏è Windows command execution still uses string concatenation for activation commands, which is less secure but necessary for compatibility
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è No resource limits per virtual environment (e.g., disk space quotas)
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è No automatic garbage collection for unused virtual environments

## Current Implementation Details
The `list_venvs` tool returns detailed information about each virtual environment:

- `name`: The name of the virtual environment
- `path`: The absolute path to the virtual environment
- `isDefault`: Whether this is the default environment
- `packages`: Approximate count of installed packages
- `description`: Optional description stored in metadata file

## Implementation Notes for Future Developers

### Virtual Environment Management
The system uses a metadata file (`venv_metadata.json`) to store descriptions for virtual environments. This file is located in the base virtual environment directory and is managed by the `VenvManager` class.

### Executing Python Code
When implementing the `execute_python` tool, ensure:
1. The virtual environment exists and is valid
2. Required packages are installed
3. Proper resource limits are enforced
4. Error handling is comprehensive
5. Security checks are implemented

### Package Management
For package installation/uninstallation:
1. Use the virtual environment's pip executable
2. Consider package dependencies
3. Validate package names and versions
4. Handle installation failures gracefully
5. Update package registry after changes
