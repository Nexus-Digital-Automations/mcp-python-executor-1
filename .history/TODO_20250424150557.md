# Python Executor MCP Server - TODO List

## Completed Tasks

1. ‚úÖ Configuration Update
   - Changed config.ts to replace `useVirtualEnv` and `venvPath` with `venvsBasePath` and `defaultVenvName`
   - Made `loadConfig()` asynchronous to create the venvsBasePath directory if it doesn't exist
   - Updated PythonConfig and ServerConfig interfaces to reflect these changes
   - Changed all references in the code to use the new configuration properties

2. ‚úÖ Virtual Environment Management
   - Created a dedicated VenvManager class in venvUtils.ts with methods for:
     - Validating venv names to prevent directory traversal attacks
     - Getting venv paths safely
     - Checking if a venv exists
     - Setting up (creating) virtual environments
     - Locking mechanism for concurrent operations (withVenvLock)
     - Getting environment details and metadata
     - Listing all available environments

3. ‚úÖ Tools API Expansion
   - Added new MCP tools for multi-venv management:
     - `list_venvs`: Lists all available venvs with their details
     - `create_venv`: Creates a new virtual environment
     - `delete_venv`: Deletes an existing virtual environment
     - `set_venv_description`: Updates the description for a venv

4. ‚úÖ Command Security Refactoring
   - Refactored command execution to improve security
   - Added array-based command execution with spawn for better security
   - Added proper error handling and validation for user input
   - Maintained legacy string-based execution for Windows activation scripts while implementing security improvements

5. ‚úÖ Per-Tool Virtual Environment Support
   - Updated tool inputSchema definitions to include optional venvName parameter for:
     - execute_python
     - install_packages 
     - uninstall_packages
     - list_packages
     - health_check
   - Updated handler methods to accept and process the venvName parameter
   - Fixed getVenvPath to use the VenvManager's getVenvPath method
   - Updated getActivationPrefix to accept venvName parameter
   - Updated checkVenvExists to use VenvManager
   - Updated getInstalledPackages to accept venvName

6. ‚úÖ Complete Tool Implementations
   - Completed `handleExecutePython` method to use the specified venv
   - Completed `handleInstallPackages` method to install packages in the specified venv
   - Completed `handleUninstallPackages` method to uninstall packages from the specified venv
   - Updated methods to use secure command execution techniques
   - Implemented proper error handling and response formatting

7. ‚úÖ Integration of Virtual Environment Handling in Existing Tools
   - Updated all handler methods (handleExecutePython, handleInstallPackages, handleUninstallPackages, handleListPackages, handleHealthCheck) to use the VenvManager
   - Updated getInstalledPackages method to use VenvManager
   - Modified verifyPythonVersion to check the target virtual environment instead of the system Python
   - Standardized the approach to handling venvName parameters across all tools
   - Improved error handling for virtual environment operations
   - Implemented consistent target environment name determination

8. ‚úÖ Removed Preinstalled Packages
   - Removed predefined packages from config.ts (packages object is now empty)
   - Updated initializePreinstalledPackages function to handle empty packages list and log accordingly
   - Removed PREINSTALLED_PACKAGES environment variable from README.md configuration example
   - Updated documentation in ARCHITECTURE.md to indicate that no packages are preinstalled by default
   - Rebuilt the project to ensure changes are reflected in the JavaScript build files
   - Updated TODO.md and NEXT_TASK.md to track these changes and guide future development
   - This change gives users more control over their environments and reduces initial overhead

9. ‚úÖ Fixed Server Initialization Process
   - Fixed TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'packages')
   - Restructured the PythonExecutorServer constructor and run() method to properly handle async initialization
   - Moved config loading, logger initialization, and venvManager setup to the run() method
   - Added proper error handling and startup logging
   - Used optional chaining (?.) for logger calls in the constructor
   - Improved the startup sequence to ensure dependencies are initialized in the correct order
   - Enhanced error handling during startup to provide clearer error messages
   - Added consistent console logging during startup for better debugging
   - Updated server version from 0.2.0 to 0.3.1 to match package.json

10. ‚úÖ Removed analyze_code Tool
   - Removed analyze_code tool definition from the tools array in setupToolHandlers
   - Removed the case handler for analyze_code in the request handler switch statement
   - Removed the handleAnalyzeCode method implementation
   - Updated documentation to reflect the removal of the tool
   - Simplified the codebase by removing an unimplemented feature

## Pending Tasks

1. üîÑ Testing
   - Add tests for the VenvManager class
   - Add tests for the modified handler methods
   - Test multi-venv operations
   - Test concurrent operations with the locking mechanism
   - Test security improvements with malicious inputs
   - Test server initialization sequence and error handling

2. üîÑ Documentation
   - Update API documentation
   - Add examples for using the multi-venv functionality
   - Document security considerations
   - Complete inline code documentation
   - Document the server initialization process and startup sequence

3. üîÑ Advanced Features
   - Implement dependency resolution to handle package conflicts
   - Add package version compatibility checking
   - Implement environment export/import functionality
   - Add metrics collection for performance monitoring

4. üîÑ Performance Optimizations
   - Implement caching for installed packages data
   - Optimize operations for large numbers of venvs
   - Add batched operations for package management

## Known Issues

1. ‚ö†Ô∏è Windows command execution still uses string concatenation for activation commands, which is less secure but necessary for compatibility
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è No resource limits per virtual environment (e.g., disk space quotas)
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è No automatic garbage collection for unused virtual environments

## Current Implementation Details
The `list_venvs` tool returns detailed information about each virtual environment:

- `name`: The name of the virtual environment
- `path`: The absolute path to the virtual environment
- `isDefault`: Whether this is the default environment
- `packages`: Approximate count of installed packages
- `description`: Optional description stored in metadata file

## Implementation Notes for Future Developers

### Virtual Environment Management
The system uses a metadata file (`venv_metadata.json`) to store descriptions for virtual environments. This file is located in the base virtual environment directory and is managed by the `VenvManager` class.

### Server Initialization Sequence
The server initialization now follows this sequence:
1. Basic server object creation and handler setup in the constructor
2. Async configuration loading in the run() method
3. Logger initialization with loaded config
4. VenvManager initialization with config and logger
5. Setup of the default virtual environment
6. Temp directory creation and cleanup interval setup
7. Initialization of any preinstalled packages (if configured)
8. Server connection establishment

This approach ensures all dependencies are properly initialized before use and provides better error handling.

### Executing Python Code
When implementing the `execute_python` tool, ensure:
1. The virtual environment exists and is valid
2. Required packages are installed
3. Proper resource limits are enforced
4. Error handling is comprehensive
5. Security checks are implemented

### Package Management
For package installation/uninstallation:
1. Use the virtual environment's pip executable
2. Consider package dependencies
3. Validate package names and versions
4. Handle installation failures gracefully
5. Update package registry after changes
