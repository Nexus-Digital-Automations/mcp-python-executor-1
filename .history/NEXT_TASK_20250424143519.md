# Next Tasks for MCP Python Executor

## What's Been Done

We've successfully implemented the configuration updates and secure virtual environment path handling changes:

1. **Configuration Update** - The PythonConfig and ServerConfig interfaces have been updated to use `venvsBasePath` and `defaultVenvName` instead of `venvPath` and `useVirtualEnv`. The `loadConfig()` function has been made asynchronous and now creates the venvsBasePath directory if it doesn't exist.

2. **Secure Virtual Environment Path Handling** - The VenvManager class now contains a `validateVenvName` function that performs security checks on environment names to prevent directory traversal attacks. The `getVenvPath` function in both VenvManager and PythonExecutorServer has been updated to use the new configuration properties and to leverage this validation.

3. **Build System** - The TypeScript code has been successfully compiled to JavaScript, and both the source and built files now consistently use the new configuration properties.

## What Needs to Be Done Next

### 1. Testing

The next major task is to create a comprehensive test suite for the updated functionality:

- **Unit Tests for VenvManager**: Create tests for all methods in the VenvManager class, especially `validateVenvName`, `getVenvPath`, and `setupVirtualEnvironment`.
- **Integration Tests**: Test the interaction between the PythonExecutorServer and VenvManager.
- **Security Tests**: Specifically test edge cases for the name validation function, including:
  - Names with path separators
  - Names with special characters
  - Names that attempt directory traversal
  - Very long names
  - Empty names
  - Reserved names

### 2. Security Hardening

Review the entire codebase for additional security improvements:

- **Input Validation**: Ensure all user inputs are properly validated before use.
- **Path Safety**: Review all file system operations for path safety.
- **Command Injection Prevention**: Ensure all command execution uses array-based arguments.
- **Error Handling**: Make sure errors are properly caught and don't reveal sensitive information.

### 3. Documentation Updates

Update the documentation to reflect the new changes:

- **README.md**: Update to include information about multiple environment support and the new configuration options.
- **API Documentation**: Update to document the new tools and their parameters.
- **Examples**: Add examples showing how to use the multi-environment features.

### 4. Performance Optimization

Consider adding performance optimizations:

- **Caching**: Add caching for frequently used data like installed packages.
- **Lazy Loading**: Consider lazy initialization of environments when first needed.
- **Concurrent Operations**: Improve handling of concurrent operations on different environments.

## Recommendations for Implementation

When implementing the tests, consider the following approach:

1. Use a mock file system to avoid actual file system operations during testing.
2. Create a separate test directory structure that can be safely created and deleted.
3. Use parameterized tests to cover multiple validation scenarios with a single test function.
4. Test both positive (valid inputs) and negative (invalid inputs) cases.

For security hardening, keep in mind:

1. Always prefer array-based command execution over string concatenation.
2. Use path.join for path construction rather than string concatenation.
3. Validate all inputs from API calls before use.
4. Always sanitize paths before using them in file operations.

## Conclusion

The changes made so far have improved the configurability and security of the MCP Python Executor. The next steps focus on ensuring these changes are well-tested, secure, and well-documented to provide a solid foundation for further development.
